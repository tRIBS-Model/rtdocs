Primary Contacts
=====================

The `tRIBS User Google Group <https://groups.google.com/g/tribs>`_ is the primary means for interactions about the model setup and applications. Model users can request membership in the Google Group. 

All other exchanges on the tRIBS code and its supporting tools are managed through the `tRIBS Github Page <https://github.com/tRIBS-Model>`_.
